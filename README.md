# Pandoc script to generate "Software Technical Writing: A Guidebook"

I have compiled all of my blog posts about technical writing, including the posts in my _Advent of Technical Writing 2023_ series, into an e-book. The working title for the book is "Software Technical Writing: A Guidebook".

All of the posts I wanted to include in the e-book were formatted in markdown. I decided to use Pandoc to turn all the posts into a PDF file.

This repository contains the shell script I wrote to process the book. The script is bespoke; it cannot be run out of the box. With that said, it may give you some inspiration if you are compiling a book from a folder of markdown files.
